## 🧩 Topics Covered

### 🔹 **Lists**
Lists are **ordered, mutable collections** used to store multiple items.  
They can hold elements of different data types and support powerful operations.

🟢 **Key Points:**
- Defined using `[ ]`
- Mutable (can be changed)
- Supports indexing and slicing


### 🔹 **Dictionaries**
Dictionaries store data as key–value pairs, allowing fast lookups and updates.

🟢 **Key Points:**
- Defined using `{}`
- Keys must be unique
- Mutable and unordered
