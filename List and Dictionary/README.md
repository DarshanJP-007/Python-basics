## 🧩 Concepts Covered

### 🔹 Lists
A **list** is an ordered, mutable collection used to store multiple items.  
You can store different data types in a list and modify elements easily.

**Examples:**
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.append("orange")       # Add item
print(fruits[1])              # Access by index
print(len(fruits))            # Get list length
